TODO
active and sleep states for MCUs [esp32 devkitv1]
Bluetooth between MCUs [esp32 devkitv1]
Accelerometer using I2C (done but not working) [mpu6050]
Barometer/thermometer using SPI [ms5607]
SD card write sensor data to .txt using SPI (wrote to csv but done)
figure out how to do active/sleep state control with bluetooth
possibly move from XCTU and develop personal code to be ran on laptop. Would involve USB2UART conversion

To Install to Work on Your Machine
Arduino IDE
esp32 library from Arduino library
Arduino extension from vscode
esp32 extension from vscode

Just google things like "arduino esp32 bluetooth" or "arduino esp32 sd card" to figure out how to implement things like that
